# Data Folder

This project originally used one dataset consisting of:
- `labels.csv`: a CSV file mapping image filenames to real ages
- `/final_files/`: a folder containing 7.6k face image files

The dataset was excluded from this repository due to GitHub’s upload limits (total size ≈ 236 MB).  
To maintain consistency across projects, this folder indicates where data files were originally stored.

If you're reviewing this project and would like access to the dataset, feel free to contact me.  
The dataset was originally provided through TripleTen for educational use.
